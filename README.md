Midjourney Office Hours Bingo 

Midjourney Office Hours Bingo is a small interactive web app designed to play Bingo during the weekly Midjourney office hours. The bingo board is generated with a set of predefined items that I collected with the help of the community. Users can click on the cells to mark them, and when a bingo is achieved, a "BINGO!" message will appear.

## Features

- Randomly generated bingo board with 25 unique items
- Clickable cells to mark items as they occur during office hours
- Bingo detection (rows, columns, and diagonals)
- Randomize board button to reset and generate a new board


## Dependencies
- built on Python-3.9.16
- dash==2.3.1
- gunicorn==20.0.4 (for deployment)
